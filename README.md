## Description

A young guy is very sad, and the environment around him was reversed to "negative". You need to avoid the sad emojis and find the happy, to finally everything goes back to normal.

Can you help that guy?

So, note the commands are reversed Arrow Left to turn Right and Arrow Right to turn Left. Also Arrow Down to Jump.
